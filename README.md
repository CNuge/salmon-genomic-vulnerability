1. ClimateDataSalmon_1980_2022.csv - here are the columns in the file:
	`"","KeyID","Name","Latitude","Longitude","Elevation","X","P","Replication","Year","Month","Day","Minimum.Air.Temperature","Air.Temperature","Maximum.Air.Temperature","Total.Precipitation","Dew.Point.Temperature","Relative.Humidity","Wind.Direction","Solar.Radiation","Atmospheric.Pressure","Snow.Precipitation","Snow.Depth.Accumulation","Snow.Water.Equivalent","Wind.Speed.at.2.meters"`


2. CIGENE_220K_Metadata_All_May18_2022 - metadata on fish and locations


3. wild_Salmo220K_NA_EU_filtered_noadmixQ5 - The filtered NA and EU wild fish genotypes
	- see: https://github.com/CNuge/salmon-euro-introgression/blob/main/scripts/wild_baseline_220k_admix_pca.r
	for the code on the filtering steps that were conducted.




## TODO -

1. convert BED/BIM/FAM to ped, then read into R.
	- see the 513 panel code in the introgression folder, you did this there already!
