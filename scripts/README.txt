# Scripts and plan
######

1. explore_tony_env_gen_pairing.r - figuring out what is in the data

   - looks like 3865 individuals with complete ENV and Genetic information. Making intermediate versions of these files for input to the subsequent analyses


2. Run PCAs on the ENV and Genetic information
  - reuse old cunner scripts for this, save a version of the dfs to managable sized tsv files (leading cols and PCs only)
  
  
3. RDA for the genetic and ENV information
  - is this feasiable with the full data set? or do I need to downsample and simplify the genotype data



4. look at MAF per location RDAs
  - drop the sample size drastically, does this agree with any per individual runs.
