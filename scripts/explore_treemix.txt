going to run on graham as its already installed there and the heavy lifting is dealt with


By default, TreeMix assumes biallelic sites. The input file is a gzipped file that consists of a header
with a space-delimited list of the names of populations, followed by lines containing the allele counts
at each SNP. It is assumed that the order of the SNPs in the file is the order of the SNPs in the
genome. The line is space delimited between populations, and the two allele within the population
are comma-delimited. For example:

pop1 pop2 pop3 pop4
5,1 1,1 4,0 0,4
3,3 0,2 2,2 0,4
1,5 0,2 2,2 1,3

TODO - need to make that file from the admixture classifications and the SNP data file (use the .raw and sum the counts, make sure the order of SNPs is the new map file)
    - do this both on a per river and a per population basis.


- to start run it without known migration events and see what gets spit out.
