#1. pull just the wildNA and the Eu wild fish (see script 24 and script 9 and build on that)

# script 9 does the whole process
# - use plink to make a new  file with those individuals
# - make a case/control file and then calculate the fst across the groups
# if info not all there, see :https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/basic_stats

#the lists of fish from script 24 should get you started.
print("all_data_admix_vals.tsv") #I copied the file to the git repo
print("see google drive for file version to use")

#############################
# 2. read in the outputs and analyze
# identify the 20% highest Fst between Europe and NA
# make a list for plink omission


#############################
# 3. omit SNPs from the wildNA with the highest Fst using plink (pull them out of the currently used file
# for the PCA in 08_cluster_map_pca_results.r)

# result: will have a new file, with the wild NA individuals, missing 20% of the SNPs that are the most Eu differentiated


#############################
# 4. then redo the PCA and make the ouput plot.
# if the LAB are now in the NFL group, can conclude that the european FST SNPs are driving the population strucutre.
