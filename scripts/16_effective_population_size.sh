# Todo this use ne_estimator or similar.
## couldn't find any good R packages so this seems like most logical way to proceed

# 1.  Preprocessing
# - need the plink files into genepop format
# - can this be done in plink?
#   - no, can use PGDSpider to go from ped - genpop
#     http://www.cmpg.unibe.ch/software/PGDSpider/#Input_and_output_formats

# 2. convert the plink files to genepop, need a folder with all of them 
#  - each of the populations, each of the three clusters
# source files found in:  
#       /raw/LD_files/             - for the populations
#       /raw/HW_files/per_location - for each of the sample locations
# Use the "new" versions relative to the v3 genome for both
# looks like family labels persist, so I'm going to try with just the cluster
# files and see if I can use these to get the location level ne estimats, 
# if not going to have to double back and convert all the populations separately

# 3. turn NE estimator on (located on desktop)
# from terminal/powershell run:
# java -jar .\NeEstimator2x1.jar


# 4. For each sample location and population, run the Ne estimation


# 5. load the results (into R? will need to look at them)
#    - process to a final table with columnns GROUP NE
